        <h2> Chief's Story </h2>
        <p class="pbox"> Jay Chief, as he was often called, was bom with a heart defect and underwent multiple heart surgeries by the age of two.
           At 11, his heart began to fail, and he required a heart transplant. In 2014, as a freshman at Summit, he received his new heart at Cincinnati Children's Hospital
            and was able to thrive socially and academically in the years following his surgery. He also ran for Summit's cross country and track teams which is an extraordinary 
            feat given his condition. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro4">
          <p> Jay Chief graduated from Summit in 2018 and attended The Ohio State University as a finance major. Jaden interned at JPMorgan Chase Bank in 
            New York City before the start of his senior year of college where he had the time of his life and made some of his closest friends. Jaden passed away on September 12,
             2021 at the age of 21 after complications with his new heart. </p>

        <h2> How 'Run for Chief' Came to Be</h2>
        <p>
          I felt compelled to start an event to remember Jay Chief 
          because of the person he was. I cannot express in words the positive impact 
          that he made on my life and countless others. He never complained about the cards 
          he was dealt or the pain he was often in. He was courageous, loving, loud, and 
          unlike anyone I have ever known before. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="second">
        <p>The "Run for Chief" race will continue Jay Chief's legacy while also benefiting those who face similar challenges to the ones he dealt with.
        The proceeds from the race will be donated to families at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital who have children receiving heart transplants just like Jaden did. Heart 
        transplants are expensive, with an average cost of $1,670,000 before insurance, and families face additional costs for travel, lodging, and food. Our goal is to alleviate a portion of that financial burden.
